		written analysis

summarize the analysis:
	The main take aways from this analysis seem to be:
	1. Schools with the lowest budget per student have the highest overall passing, and schools with the highest
	   budget per student have the lowest
	2. Medium sized schools (1000-2000 students) have the highest overall passing, and large schools have the lowest
	3. Charter schools have a higher overall passing than districts
	Of course there are further comparisons you could make about the data with other potential DataFrames, but with
	the DataFrames we created these seem to be the most important points.

draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations:
	One interesting comparison I noticed is the relationship between 'spending per student' and 'overall passing'.
 	Originally I would have thought, more spending per student = higher overall passing, but the data seems to show the opposite;
	the lowest budget range has the highest overall passing, and the highest budget has the lowest overall passing. I believe the
	school size may play a role in this comparison, which brings me to my second point: the small and medium school sizes have the
	highest overall passing scores. Smaller schools would normally be unable to accumulate as much budget as a larger school, therefore
	being unable to allocate more budget per student. Although smaller/ medium sized schools may have less budget, they are notorious
	for putting more effort and personalization into individual students. The correlations between 'spending per student', 'school size'
	and 'overall passing' definitely bring up some interesting questions about the role budget plays in student success.
